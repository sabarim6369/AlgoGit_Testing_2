Here is a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

**Concept:** The given code is an implementation of a solution to find the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers. The sequence is represented as a vector of integers, where one number is missing.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of elements in the sequence, including the missing one.

`int n = arr.size() + 1;`

In this step, we are adding 1 to the size of the input vector because the vector represents a sequence of consecutive integers, and the last number is missing.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total sum of the sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

`int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;`

This formula calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers. In this case, we are using it to calculate the sum of the sequence from 0 to n (inclusive), where n is the total number of elements including the missing one.

**Step 3:** Calculate the sum of the actual elements present in the input vector.

`int sum = 0;`
`for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {`
`sum += arr[i];`
`}`

In this step, we are iterating through each element in the input vector and adding it to the `sum` variable.

**Step 4:** Calculate the missing number by subtracting the actual sum from the total sum.

`return total - sum;`

The missing number is the difference between the total sum of the sequence (including the missing one) and the actual sum of the elements present in the input vector.

**Output:** The missing number is returned as the result of the function.

This solution assumes that the input vector represents a sequence of consecutive integers with one missing number. The complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.
