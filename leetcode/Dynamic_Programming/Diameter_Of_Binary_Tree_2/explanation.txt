Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept used in the given code:

**TreeNode Class**

The TreeNode class is used to represent a node in a binary tree. Each node has three properties:

* `val`: an integer value stored in the node
* `left`: a pointer to the left child node (initially set to `nullptr`)
* `right`: a pointer to the right child node (initially set to `nullptr`)

There are three constructors for the TreeNode class:

1. `TreeNode()`: initializes the node with `val` set to 0 and `left` and `right` set to `nullptr`
2. `TreeNode(int x)`: initializes the node with `val` set to `x` and `left` and `right` set to `nullptr`
3. `TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`: initializes the node with `val` set to `x` and `left` and `right` set to the provided child nodes

**Diameter of a Binary Tree**

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This problem is asking to find the maximum diameter of a binary tree, which is the maximum path length between any two leaf nodes.

**Solution Class**

The Solution class contains a method `diameterOfBinaryTree` that calculates the diameter of a given binary tree.

**helper Method**

The `helper` method is a recursive function that calculates the diameter of the binary tree. It takes a `TreeNode` as input and returns an integer value.

Here's what the `helper` method does:

1. If the input node is `nullptr`, return 0 (since there's no diameter for an empty tree)
2. Calculate the maximum diameter of the left subtree using `helper(node->left)`
3. Calculate the maximum diameter of the right subtree using `helper(node->right)`
4. Update the global variable `maxdiameter` with the maximum of the current `maxdiameter` and the sum of the left and right diameters
5. Return 1 plus the maximum of the left and right diameters (this is the diameter of the current node)

**diameterOfBinaryTree Method**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method takes a `TreeNode` as input and returns the maximum diameter of the binary tree. It simply calls the `helper` method on the root node and returns the updated `maxdiameter` value.

Overall, the code uses a bottom-up approach to calculate the diameter of the binary tree. It recursively traverses the tree, updating the maximum diameter at each node, and finally returns the maximum diameter found.
