The given code is implementing the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. A class named `Solution` is defined, which contains a method `fib` to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number.

2. In the `fib` method, the base case is handled by returning 0 when `n` is 0. This is because the 0th Fibonacci number is 0.

3. Two integer variables `prevprev` and `prev` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. In the Fibonacci sequence, the first two numbers are 0 and 1.

4. The method then enters a for loop that runs from `i=2` to `n`. This loop iterates `n-1` times to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number.

5. Inside the loop, the current Fibonacci number (`curr`) is calculated by adding the two previous Fibonacci numbers (`prevprev` and `prev`). This is the recursive formula of the Fibonacci sequence.

6. The values of `prevprev` and `prev` are then updated to `prev` and `curr`, respectively. This is done to keep track of the previous two Fibonacci numbers for the calculation of the next one.

7. After the loop finishes, the method returns the last calculated Fibonacci number (`prev`), which is the `n`th Fibonacci number.

The time complexity of this method is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), making it efficient for large values of `n`.
