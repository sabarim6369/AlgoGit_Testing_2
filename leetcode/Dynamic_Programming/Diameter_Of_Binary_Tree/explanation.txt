This code is used to find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept:

1. The `TreeNode` class is defined to represent a node in a binary tree. Each node has an integer value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).

2. The `Solution` class is defined to solve the diameter of binary tree problem. It uses a helper function `helper` to calculate the diameter and a public function `diameterOfBinaryTree` to call the helper function and return the diameter.

3. In the `helper` function, it traverses the binary tree in a depth-first manner (starting from the root node). For each node, it calculates the maximum diameter that can be calculated from the left and right subtrees of the current node. If a diameter calculated from the left or right subtree is greater than the current maximum diameter, the new diameter becomes the maximum diameter.

4. It also calculates the longest path passing through the current node and stores it in `leftmax` and `rightmax`. The longest path passing through the current node is the longest path between its left child and right child.

5. The function returns the maximum of the longest path passing through the current node (`1+max(leftmax, rightmax)`), which represents the maximum length of the path between the left child and the right child of a given node, and it recursively calls itself for the left and right subtrees of the current node to calculate their maximum diameter.

6. In the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function, the `helper` function is called with the root node of the binary tree, and the maximum diameter calculated by the `helper` function is returned.

Here is the pseudocode for the helper function:

```
function helper(node):
    if node is null:
        return 0
    leftMax = helper(node.left)
    rightMax = helper(node.right)
    maxDiameter = max(maxDiameter, leftMax + rightMax)
    return 1 + max(leftMax, rightMax)
```

In this pseudocode, `maxDiameter` stores the maximum diameter of the binary tree, `leftMax` is the maximum diameter of the left subtree, `rightMax` is the maximum diameter of the right subtree, and `1 + max(leftMax, rightMax)` is the maximum diameter of the current node.
