Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept used in the given code:

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Step 2: Defining a Solution**

The solution uses a recursive function `helper` to calculate the maximum diameter of the binary tree. The function takes a node as input and returns the maximum diameter of the subtree rooted at that node.

**Step 3: Understanding the `helper` Function**

The `helper` function does the following:

* If the node is `nullptr`, it returns 0, indicating that the diameter of an empty tree is 0.
* It recursively calculates the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees rooted at the current node, and stores these values in `leftmax` and `rightmax` respectively.
* It updates the maximum diameter of the binary tree (`maxdiameter`) to be the maximum of the current maximum diameter and the sum of `leftmax` and `rightmax`.
* It returns 1 plus the maximum of `leftmax` and `rightmax`, which represents the height of the current node.

**Step 4: Understanding the `diameterOfBinaryTree` Function**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function is the main entry point for the problem. It calls the `helper` function with the root node of the binary tree as input, and returns the maximum diameter of the binary tree, which is stored in the `maxdiameter` variable.

**Key Concepts**

* Recursion: The `helper` function is recursive, meaning it calls itself to calculate the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees.
* Dynamic Programming: The `maxdiameter` variable is used to store the maximum diameter of the binary tree, which is updated iteratively as the function recalculates the maximum diameter of each subtree.
* Tree Traversal: The `helper` function traverses the binary tree in a depth-first manner, visiting each node and calculating the maximum diameter of its subtree.

By using these concepts, the code efficiently calculates the maximum diameter of a binary tree, which is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
