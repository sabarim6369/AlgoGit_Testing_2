Here's a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

**Binary Tree Node Definition**

The code defines a struct `TreeNode` for representing a node in a binary tree. Each node has three properties:
- `val`: an integer value
- `left`: a pointer to the left child node (initially set to `nullptr`)
- `right`: a pointer to the right child node (initially set to `nullptr`)

There are three constructor functions for `TreeNode`:
- `TreeNode()`: a default constructor that initializes the node with a value of 0 and `left` and `right` set to `nullptr`
- `TreeNode(int x)`: a constructor that initializes the node with a given value `x` and `left` and `right` set to `nullptr`
- `TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`: a constructor that initializes the node with a given value `x` and left and right child nodes `left` and `right`

**Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**

The `Solution` class has a function `levelOrder` that performs a level order traversal of a binary tree and returns the result in a 2D vector `result`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the `levelOrder` function:
1. Initialize an empty queue `q` and an empty 2D vector `result` to store the level order traversal result.

2. Enqueue the root node of the binary tree into the queue `q` if it is not `nullptr`.

3. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue `q` and push its value into a new vector `temp` in the `result` 2D vector.
   - If the dequeued node has a left child, enqueue the child into the queue `q`.
   - If the dequeued node has a right child, enqueue the child into the queue `q`.
   
The `levelOrder` function effectively performs a level order traversal of the binary tree by traversing each level from left to right and adding the node values to the `result` 2D vector.
