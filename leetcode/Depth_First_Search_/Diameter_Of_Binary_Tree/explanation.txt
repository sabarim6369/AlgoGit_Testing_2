Here is a step-by-step explanation of the given code:

**The TreeNode class**

The `TreeNode` class represents a node in a binary tree. Each node has three attributes:

* `val`: an integer value stored in the node
* `left`: a pointer to the left child node
* `right`: a pointer to the right child node
* `maxdiameter`: an integer variable to store the maximum diameter of the binary tree (initialized to 0)

There are three constructors for the `TreeNode` class:

* `TreeNode()`: an empty constructor that initializes `val` to 0, `left` to `nullptr`, and `right` to `nullptr`
* `TreeNode(int x)`: a constructor that initializes `val` to `x`, `left` to `nullptr`, and `right` to `nullptr`
* `TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`: a constructor that initializes `val` to `x`, `left` to `left`, and `right` to `right`

**The Solution class**

The `Solution` class has one method, `diameterOfBinaryTree`, which calculates the diameter of a given binary tree.

**The diameterOfBinaryTree method**

This method takes a pointer to the root node of the binary tree as input and returns the diameter of the tree.

Here's what the method does:

1. It initializes a variable `maxdiameter` to 0, which will store the maximum diameter found so far.
2. It calls a helper function `helper` with the root node as input.
3. The `helper` function recursively traverses the binary tree, computing the maximum diameter of the left and right subtrees and updating `maxdiameter` if necessary.
4. The `helper` function also returns the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees, which will be used to calculate the diameter.
5. The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method returns the value of `maxdiameter`, which is the maximum diameter found in the binary tree.

**The helper function**

The `helper` function is a recursive function that takes a node pointer as input and returns the maximum depth of the subtree rooted at that node.

Here's what the `helper` function does:

1. If the input node is `nullptr`, it returns 0, indicating that the subtree is empty.
2. It recursively calls itself on the left and right child nodes and stores the results in `leftmax` and `rightmax`, respectively.
3. It updates `maxdiameter` with the maximum diameter found so far, which is the sum of the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees.
4. It returns the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees, which is the maximum of the depths of the two subtrees plus 1 (for the current node).

By recursively traversing the binary tree and combining the maximum depths of the left and right subtrees, the `helper` function calculates the maximum diameter of the binary tree and updates `maxdiameter` accordingly. The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method then returns the value of `maxdiameter`.
