Here is a step-by-step explanation of the concept used in the given code:

**Class Definition**

The code defines a class `Solution` that has a public member variable `maxdiameter` and a private helper function `helper`.

**Constructor**

The class uses a constructor with three different overloads to create a `TreeNode` object. The constructors are:

* `TreeNode()`: Initializes the `val` member to 0 and sets both `left` and `right` pointers to `nullptr`.
* `TreeNode(int x)`: Initializes the `val` member to `x` and sets both `left` and `right` pointers to `nullptr`.
* `TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`: Initializes the `val` member to `x` and sets the `left` and `right` pointers to the provided `left` and `right` nodes, respectively.

**Helper Function**

The `helper` function is a recursive function that takes a `TreeNode*` object as an argument. The function does the following:

1. If the `node` is `nullptr`, return 0.
2. Calculate the maximum diameter of the left subtree by recursively calling the `helper` function with the `left` child node.
3. Calculate the maximum diameter of the right subtree by recursively calling the `helper` function with the `right` child node.
4. Update the `maxdiameter` member variable with the maximum value between the current `maxdiameter` and the sum of the maximum diameters of the left and right subtrees.
5. Return the maximum value between the height of the current node (1 + the maximum of the left and right subtrees) and the maximum diameters of the left and right subtrees.

**main Function**

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function is the main function that takes a `TreeNode*` object as an argument. The function:

1. Calls the `helper` function with the `root` node as an argument to compute the maximum diameter of the binary tree.
2. Returns the `maxdiameter` member variable, which holds the maximum diameter of the binary tree.

In summary, the code uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree, calculating the maximum diameter of each subtree and updating the `maxdiameter` member variable accordingly. The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function returns the maximum diameter of the entire binary tree.
