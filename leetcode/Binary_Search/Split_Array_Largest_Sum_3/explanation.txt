This is a C++ code that solves a problem called "Split Array Largest Sum After K Moves". Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept used in the code:

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, split the array into `k` non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Class `Solution` and Method `splitArray`**:
The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `splitArray` that takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as input. This method returns the minimum possible largest sum of any subarray after splitting the array into `k` non-empty subarrays.

2. **Binary Search**:
The code uses binary search to find the minimum possible largest sum of any subarray. The search range is from the maximum element in the array (`left`) to the sum of all elements in the array (`right`).

3. **Midpoint and `ispossible` Method**:
At each iteration, the code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the search range (`left` and `right`). It then calls the `ispossible` method to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the largest sum not exceeding `mid`.

4. **`ispossible` Method**:
The `ispossible` method checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the largest sum not exceeding `mid`. It iterates through the array and maintains a running sum `currsum` and a count of subarrays `count`. If the current element `a` is greater than `mid`, it returns `false`. If `currsum+a` exceeds `mid`, it resets `currsum` and increments `count`. If `count` exceeds `k`, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

5. **Updating the Search Range**:
If `ispossible` returns `true`, the code updates the search range to the left of `mid` (`right = mid-1`). If `ispossible` returns `false`, the code updates the search range to the right of `mid` (`left = mid+1`).

6. **Finding the Minimum Largest Sum**:
The code continues the binary search until `left` exceeds `right`. The final minimum largest sum is returned as `minans`.

This approach ensures that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized, as required in the problem statement.
